## Usability test
### Introduction
The purpose of usability testing is to help UI/UX designers get a better understanding of how users can more efficiently and effectively use web pages and applications while maintaining a positive attitude. The end goal in mind when conducting usability testing is to have users wanting to keep using the web page/application making it a win-win for both the users and web page/application developers.  

I will conduct a usability test on Alaska’s Department of Fish and Game website. After conducting a heuristic evaluation I found there to be a few issues with the website's layout specifically with helping users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors, the consistency and standards, and a match between the system and the real world.

Being that the department of Fish and Game is a tourist’s go to page when coming to Alaska I want to assess typical tasks a tourist might complete either before coming to Alaska or while being there. In the first task I will have the user sign up for email notifications from Alaska’s Wildlife Conservation. The second task will require the user to report a wildlife encounter with a predetermined location. Lastly, I will have the user go to the tips and safety page for viewing in Alaska. In doing this I hope to get a better understanding of how usability experience can improve

### Usability Testing Setting 
The UT session was conducted via zoom. The user and myself were communicating via laptop’s while I screen recorded the users page and their audio.

### Summary 
After conducting the usability test I learned a lot of things about Alaska's Department of Fish and Game webpage and the usability test process that I was not aware of. 

To begin with with the usability test process is much lengthier than expected. I expected prepping the material to be the longest part of the process however, communicating the UT script and survey to the user proved to be longer than expected. In doing this I learned that instructions via the survey must be as detailed as possible. The user I recruited seemed to be a bit confused when instructed on the tasks to complete. This slowed down the time it took for her to complete each tasks. In the real world I would assume that the moderator must go back and create more detailed instructions and script. I also learned that as a moderator one must be patient, I found myself giving the user extra instructions to help them complete the tasks. Ultimately, I believe that before reading the script to the user I should read the script and questionnaire as if I was being recruited, this will help the usability test go smoother.

When it came to Alaska's Department of Fish and Game the issues I personally found were not very similar to the issues the user found, which opened my eyes in terms of whats really important to a first time user. Being that I analyzed the website after just learning each of the 10 heuristics, I feel as if I analyzed the smaller issues at hand. When the user went on the website she was immediately intimidated by the webpages aesthetic, something I bypassed simply because I was paying attention to the small details. After analyzing the footage of the usability test, I realized that aesthetic and minimalist design is the most important issue in the eyes of a tourist using the webpage for the first time. Some of the tasks the user completed could take place in a high stress situation and any extra added time would be a major inconvenience leading to less satisfaction. Overall, the webpage seems to be way to crowded for the user, which in turn leads them to click on the first option they think is right.
